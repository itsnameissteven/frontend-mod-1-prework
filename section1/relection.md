## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I would say my top three are:
  * Teach others what the need to know
  * Adopt a growth mindset
  * Approach learning as a process

I would like to include more reading into my lifestyle and remember to take breaks more often.

Something that I utilize a lot when studying music is walk away from what I am learning for the night.  For me it helps my brain process the information overnight and when I come back to it, I seem to have a better grasp.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* String - Characters within the bounds of quotes either " " or ' '.  It doesn't matter what you use as long as it is consistent
* Numbers - any number positive, or zero. Numbers can have decimals as well.  You should not use quotations when utilizing number data.
* Boolean - can only have a value of true or false. When using booleans make sure true and false are lowercase.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```JavaScript
console.log("Hello World!");
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// or /* */
You can use code comments for your future self or others to explain your thought process on a code or what a code should do.
Code comments are also useful if you want to comment out code so that it doesn't run.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is something that may change overtime.  For instance if a variable is "yourAge", right now that would be 5. Next year when I ask you yourAge you will be 6 so it varies through the years

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I use a trading platform thinkorswim.  The stock name would be a string variable, price would be number number variable, and amount of stocks owned would also be a number variable.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation would be the joining of two or more variables. You use + to indicate that you want to join the variables. Using Concatenation allows you to join different variables together

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
The weather app comes to mind, you can join together day/time, temperature, and weather condition

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option.
  In this example:
  `YOU DO: log to the console the result of "hello" is equal to "Hello":`
  ```javascript
  console.log("hello" == "Hello");
  ```
  When we tell the computer that two conflicting things are equal we want it to register as false? Why not code?
  ```javascript
  console.log("hello" != "Hello");
  ```
Also is there a difference between == and === ?
