## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Seeking out challenges stuck out to me.  I am constantly pushing myself to be challenged and continue to grow.  I was also glad to hear that asking questions is a sign of strength. As someone who tends to ask a lot of when learning or stuck it was a relief.  
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I approach developing new skills by focusing on the process.  For example, I have taken up auto mechanics in recent years, and even though I am not particularly great at it I can solve issues on my car if I break it down to one step at a time.  I will attempt to diagnose a problem, fix or replace what I hypothesize the issue to be.  If the issue continues after I work on the car,  I will take a step back, reevaluate the issue, and find a different approach.  Even if the work oI do on the car doesn't solve the issue I can still walk away with a positive - I've learned what didn't work, and I've learned how to work on a different part of my car.  I use this method in many aspects of my life when learning something new.
* Something I don't do and should is set S.M.A.R.T. goals. Although I have a goal in mind for what I want to accomplish, I rarely break it down to smaller objectives.  Moving forward I think it will be important for my work at Turing and beyond.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Venmo comes to mind. When I look at my transaction history I have a list of incoming or outgoing payments, who it is from and a message corresponding to the transaction.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a way to interact with an array.  Through methods you can add to, remove, select, sort, omit ect.  Array methods are great tools that can facilitate a cleaner code.  

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is a more efficient way of coding for repeated processes.  Rather than type code out multiple times to get a task done you can assign a loop to automate the process based on if a value is true or not.  You can use a loop with an array if you would like to incorporate the elements of the array to complete a code block .  Using loops with arrays allow you to repeat a process for the number of elements in an array, this is handy because an array my change the amount of elements it contains.  Using loops without arrays allow you to specify the exact amount of times you want a loop to complete.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop allows you to complete a task over and over again until you specify it to stop.  If you had to pick up all the toys on the ground would I ask you to pick up a toy over and over again until the floor was clean? Probably not.  With a loop I can tell you to pick up your toys until there are no more toys on the ground. The loop I ask you to do would look like this
* There are 3 toys on the ground (initialization), pick up the toys until there are none left (condition), there is one less toy on the floor(update)
* Repeat this process until there are 0 toys on the floor


1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
When using array methods, would coding the method inside a loop cause any errors? Is it better practice to call a method outside a loop? I was able to use a method in one of my loops I submitted but wonder what makes most sense when things get more complicated.
