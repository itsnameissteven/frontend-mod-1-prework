## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It felt pretty much the same as the previous week.  I regularly take breaks to allow to absorption of new information.  Using the Pomodoro method was a great reminder to keep a scheduled break, I will continue experimenting on what work/ break times work best for me
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I was distracted. My mind kept tracing back to the thought of how much time was left on the timer.  At times I became frustrated about how much I was thinking about how much time elapsed  
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object is a variable that can store complex data.  You can access them by calling on a string rather than an index number.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - an array because complex data isn't needed for each element.
  * List of states and their capitals -an array, although you could use an object and store a data capital inside the object I don't think it's  since state capitals don't change
  * List of things to pack for vacation - an object since the amount of what you may want to pack can be organized or changed in a more efficient manor.  
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow- An object since those accounts may have have different data tied to the account
  * List of student names and their cohort- An array, since these will not likely change
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake- An object because we can store different data types and they may change each time you bake the cake.
  * All my favorite restaurants- An array, another list that wont hold a lot of data and will likely not change.  

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
slack:
channel = "general"
amountOfMembers = 43
timeStamp = "12:03 PM"
username = "Steven Mancine"
postContent = "what about tomorrow?"
profilePicture = img

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I tried to console log "console.log(burrito.addProtein())" and noticed it wouldn't log how I expect it to.
ultimately I had to run burrito.changeProtein(); console.log(buritto);
is there a more efficient way to do this? Are we not able to change methods or functions together?
